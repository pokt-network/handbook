[Detailed Explanation]
## Report of Immediate Action
### Detailed Summary of executed Immediate Action
As part of the separation between the Ecosystem and Engineering teams, a new Ecosystem Engineering team had to be hired and onboarded to take care of the business and ecosystem development needs of the Ecosystem Team. The positions that I was tasked for hiring were:

- Solutions Architect (Not yet hired)
- Fullstack Javascript Engineer (Hired)
- SRE Engineer (Hired)
- Infrastructure Tooling Engineer (Hired)

Each position required multiple talent pool filters, interviews, technical test design and review, as well as final selection decision making and onboarding.

### Evidence and Justification of the need for the Immediate Action:**
Without an Ecosystem Engineering team, the PNI organization would have not been able to focus and reduce it's workload which was causing massive amounts of strain in the quality and delivery of the engineering organization.
